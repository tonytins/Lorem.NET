# Lorem.NET

A .NET library for all things random!

## Usage

### Text Helpers

```csharp
// this will generate a string with three words:
string words = LoremNET.Generate.Words(3);

// this will generate a string with two to five words:
string words = LoremNET.Generate.Words(2, 5);

// this will generate a string with five to ten words with "uppercaseFirstLetter" set to "false" and "includePunctuation" set to "true":
string words = LoremNET.Generate.Words(5, 10, false, true);

// a sentence is the same as "Words" except that it will include punctuation by default and will include a "." at the end of a string:
string sentence = LoremNET.Generate.Sentence(5, 10);

// a paragraph is a string composed of multiple sentences; this paragraph will have five to six words per sentence, and four to ten sentences:
string paragraph = LoremNET.Generate.Paragraph(5, 6, 4, 10);

// paragraphs is an array of paragraphs; this method will have eight to nine words per sentence, four to five sentences per paragraph, and one to three paragraphs:
string[] paragraphs = LoremNET.Generate.Paragraphs(8, 9, 4, 5, 1, 3);
```

### Extras

```csharp
// this will generate a random valid email address:
string email = LoremNET.Generate.Email();

// this will generate a random hex number (i.e. a color)
string hex = LoremNET.Generate.HexNumber();

// this will generate a random DateTime object between 1/1/1950 and the current DateTime:
DateTime dateTime = LoremNET.Generate.DateTime();

// this will generate a random DateTime object between 1/1/1995 and 12/31/2020:
DateTime dateTime = LoremNET.Generate.DateTime(new DateTime(1995, 1, 1), new DateTime(2020, 12, 31))

// this will return "true" 55% of the time:
bool isTruth = LoremNET.Generate.Chance(55, 100);

// this will randomly select an item from the group:
string[] numbers = GetNumbers();
string number = LoremNET.Generate.Random(numbers);

// this will randomly select a value from the enum:
MyEnum value = LoremNET.Generate.Enum<MyEnum>();

```
